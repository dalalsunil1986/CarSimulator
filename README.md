# CarSimulator
Java app that I made in my free time to practice Java.

It draws a grid and a car (rectangle-based) and the user can move the car using the key arrows.
I used the library stdlib.jar by Princeton University for drawing (thanks!): http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/
The app has never been finished unfortunately.
